#Using Bluefruit BLE to Give Disabled Users Switch Control to iOS Devices

These are the sample sketches to go with the tutorial on the Adafruit Learning System at this URL

[https://learn.adafruit.com/ios-switch-control-using-ble/] (https://learn.adafruit.com/ios-switch-control-using-ble/)

There are three versions of the source code for this project. All of them are available in a GitHub repository in the link below. The three versions are:

*Simple: This is a simple version of the code that duplicates the functionality of the EZ-Key device we described earlier. You would use it if you are using a feather board to take advantage of the built-in battery charger but needed no other functionality.
*Multimode: This version shows how you can switch out of iOS Switch Control mode and use the feather board for some other functionality.
*Corded: This version shows how you can get more functionality by allowing for the pressing of multiple switches simultaneously.

All of the examples in this tutorial have been tested with both 32u4 and M0 feather devices. We recommend that you start with implementing the "simple" version first and then move on to the other versions if you need additional functionality.
